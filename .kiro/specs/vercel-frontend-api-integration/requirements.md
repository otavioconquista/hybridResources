# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves configuring the existing HTML frontend and Flask API to work together seamlessly on Vercel's platform. The current setup has a static HTML file that makes API calls to Flask endpoints, but needs proper Vercel configuration to serve both the frontend and API endpoints correctly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy my HTML frontend and Flask API to Vercel, so that users can access the web application with working API functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed to Vercel THEN the index.html SHALL be served as the main frontend
2. WHEN users access the root URL THEN the system SHALL serve the index.html file
3. WHEN the frontend makes API calls to /match_vaga and /match_vagas THEN the Flask API SHALL respond correctly
4. WHEN static assets are requested THEN Vercel SHALL serve them efficiently

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the frontend to communicate with the API without CORS issues, so that I can use all the matchmaking features seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes POST requests to API endpoints THEN the system SHALL NOT return CORS errors
2. WHEN API responses are returned THEN the frontend SHALL display results correctly
3. WHEN file uploads are submitted THEN the API SHALL process them without cross-origin issues

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper Vercel configuration files, so that the deployment process is automated and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to Vercel THEN the system SHALL use a vercel.json configuration file
2. WHEN the Flask app starts THEN it SHALL be configured as a serverless function
3. WHEN static files are accessed THEN they SHALL be served from the appropriate directory
4. WHEN API routes are called THEN they SHALL be properly routed to the Flask application

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Flask application to be Vercel-compatible, so that it can run as a serverless function.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Flask app is deployed THEN it SHALL be wrapped in a Vercel-compatible handler
2. WHEN requests are made to the API THEN the serverless function SHALL initialize correctly
3. WHEN the application handles file uploads THEN it SHALL work within Vercel's serverless constraints
4. WHEN dependencies are installed THEN they SHALL be compatible with Vercel's Python runtime
